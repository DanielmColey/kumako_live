					<h1>Meet the Staff</h1>
					<p>Mukashi mukashi aru tokoro ni, Sara began learning about Web Design, but she didnâ€™t care much for coding. Dan meanwhile became extremely proficient at the coding. They decided it would be fun to team up and fight boring branding together. After all, twenty fingers are better than ten, and Kuma-Ko was born. Working desk by desk, they slay generic templates and unfulfilled dreams. But only when the baby is asleep. Sara handles the front end, where she makes stuff look pretty. Dan takes care of the truly exciting stuff that happens off-screen. In their spare time, they are working on a thrilling comic book series and attend cons from time to time. They are major nerds.</p>
